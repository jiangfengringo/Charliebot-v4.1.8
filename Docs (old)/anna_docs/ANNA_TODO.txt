Thanks for your interest in the project.
At this point, development will now become centered on improving specific problems with Anna that you find in conversations with her.

+ All references to being a robot should now be removed. If not, please alert aothman@umich.edu

+ More responses are always nice. More things incorporating the topics, away from Science Fiction and towards Atlanta and sports and why Anna is at the Loebner prize competition.

+ The general "style" of Anna should be more playful than ALICE...With lots of references to Atlanta.

+ Examples of any weaknesses found should be sent to aothman@umich.edu
